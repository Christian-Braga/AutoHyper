  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "A typical hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem consists of **five essential components** . AutoHyper is designed to give users full control and flexibility over each of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Learner`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The learner is the machine learning model to be tuned. In AutoHyper, any supervised model following the **scikit-learn API** is supported. This includes both classifiers and regressors such as RandomForestClassifier, XGBRegressor, LogisticRegression, and even custom models wrapped using **SciKeras** (for Keras) or **Skorch** (for PyTorch). The only requirement is that the model must implement `fit(X, y)`, `predict(X)`, and `set_params(**kwargs)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Hyperparameter Space`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The search space defines the set of hyperparameters to explore. AutoHyper allows users to specify this space as a dictionary of parameter names and candidate values. The search space is dynamically parsed based on the selected optimization strategy. When needed particularly in random search or evolutionary algorithms, AutoHyper can **automatically infer and apply the most appropriate value scale** for each hyperparameter, such as linear sampling for float and integer parameters, and categorical sampling for discrete options. This enables more efficient exploration, especially when dealing with large or non-uniform hyperparameter domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Dataset`**\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoHyper is specifically tailored for **tabular datasets**, where `X` is a `pandas.DataFrame` and `y` is a `pandas.Series` or `numpy.ndarray`. The dataset is passed directly to the HPO class and internally split according to the specified resampling strategy. The package assumes clean, preprocessed data, leaving feature engineering and preprocessing under the user's control for maximal transparency and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`Resampling Strategy`** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid overfitting and ensure unbiased evaluation, AutoHyper leverages **nested cross-validation**. The outer loop estimates generalization performance, while the inner loop performs hyperparameter tuning. Users can configure the number of outer and inner folds (`n_outer_folds`, `n_inner_folds`), making the resampling strategy fully customizable. This separation guarantees a rigorous assessment of how the chosen hyperparameters would perform on truly unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`Performance Measure`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is handled using common metrics like accuracy, f1, precision, recall for classification and r2, neg_mean_squared_error, etc., for regression. The user specifies the metric via the scoring parameter. Internally, AutoHyper calculates average performance for each configuration across all outer folds and applies a **custom weighted scoring function** that balances average performance with robustness (measured as frequency of selection), ensuring the final recommendation is both strong and stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`Optimization Strategy`**\n",
    "AutoHyper supports multiple optimization strategies, including:\n",
    "- **Grid Search**: Exhaustively explores all combinations of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- **Random Search**: Samples a fixed number of random configurations from the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Uses genetic algorithms to evolve hyperparameter configurations over generations, balancing exploration and exploitation."
